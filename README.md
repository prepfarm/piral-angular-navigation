# Problems

1. Having defined routes in `my-pilet` (Angular), clicking on routes defined in Shell app will throw an error in console `Error: NG04002: 'route-name'` if that route is not defined in the Angular router.
2. Removing route definition from `my-pilet` will prevent the error above, but if you click on `Sample` and then click again on the same link, same error will be thrown.

Navigation works fine, but error logs are thrown.
